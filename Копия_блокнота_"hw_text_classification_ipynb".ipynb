        "## Ход работы\n",
        "Оценка за домашнее задание складывается из четырех частей:\n",
        "### Запуск базовой модели с семинара на новом датасете (1 балл)\n",
        "На семинаре мы создали модель, которая дает на нашей задаче довольно высокое качество. Ваша цель --- обучить ее и вычислить `score`, который затем можно будет использовать в качестве бейзлайна.\n",
        "\n",
        "В модели появится одно важное изменение: количество классов теперь равно не 2, а 4. Обратите на это внимание и найдите, что в коде создания модели нужно модифицировать, чтобы учесть это различие.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Проведение экспериментов по улучшению модели (2 балла за каждый эксперимент)\n",
        "Чтобы улучшить качество базовой модели, можно попробовать различные идеи экспериментов. Каждый выполненный эксперимент будет оцениваться в 2 балла. Для получения полного балла за этот пункт вам необходимо выполнить по крайней мере 2 эксперимента. Не расстраивайтесь, если какой-то эксперимент не дал вам прироста к качеству: он все равно зачтется, если выполнен корректно.\n",
        "\n",
        "Вот несколько идей экспериментов:\n",
        "* **Модель RNN**. Попробуйте другие нейросетевые модели --- LSTM и GRU. Мы советуем обратить внимание на [GRU](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.GRU.html), так как интерфейс этого класса ничем не отличается от обычной Vanilla RNN, которую мы использовали на семинаре.\n",
        "* **Увеличение количества рекуррентных слоев модели**. Это можно сделать с помощью параметра `num_layers` в классе `nn.RNN`. В такой модели выходы первой RNN передаются в качестве входов второй RNN и так далее.\n",
        "* **Изменение архитектуры после применения RNN**. В базовой модели используется агрегация со всех эмбеддингов. Возможно, вы захотите конкатенировать результат агрегации и эмбеддинг с последнего токена.\n",
        "* **Подбор гиперпараметров и обучение до сходимости**. Возможно, для получения более высокого качества просто необходимо увеличить количество эпох обучения нейросети, а также попробовать различные гиперпараметры: размер словаря, `dropout_rate`, `hidden_dim`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Обратите внимание, что главное правило проведения экспериментов --- необходимо совершать одно архитектурное изменение в одном эксперименте. Если вы совершите несколько изменений, то будет неясно, какое именно из изменений дало прирост к качеству.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Получение высокого качества (3 балла)\n",
        "В конце вашей работы вы должны указать, какая из моделей дала лучший результат, и вывести качество, которое дает лучшая модель, с помощью функции `evaluate`. Ваша модель будет оцениваться по метрике `accuracy` следующим образом:\n",
        "* $accuracy < 0.9$ --- 0 баллов;\n",
        "* $0.9 \\leqslant accuracy < 0.91$ --- 1 балл;\n",
        "* $0.91 \\leqslant accuracy < 0.915$ --- 2 балла;\n",
        "* $0.915 \\leqslant accuracy$ --- 3 балла.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Оформление отчета (2 балла)\n",
        "В конце работы подробно опишите все проведенные эксперименты.\n",
        "* Укажите, какие из экспериментов принесли улучшение, а какие --- нет.\n",
        "* Проанализируйте графики сходимости моделей в проведенных экспериментах. Являются ли колебания качества обученных моделей существенными в зависимости от эпохи обучения, или же сходимость стабильная?\n",
        "* Укажите, какая модель получилась оптимальной.\n",
        "\n",
        "Желаем удачи!"
